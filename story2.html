                    <p class="storytext">The zombies have been coming for us every night. And they're getting bigger and stronger with each attack. We don't know what we can do against these beasts, but we must do something. We need to fight back.
                        I've noticed that some of my fellow survivors have become more aggressive lately. They seem to be taking their anger out on the zombies by killing them whenever possible. I think it's time for me to take action before someone gets hurt.
                        After dark, Galena and I sneak away from camp without saying anything. We quickly head toward the woods where there are large groups of zombies roaming around at all times. As soon as we get into the trees, I send a silent command to our bondstone. Instantly, a small light appears in the palm of my hand. It shines brightly and illuminates our path through the forest.
                        I lead the way as we carefully move forward. Galena is on my right side, and two other companions follow behind us. Galena is holding a stick in front of her to scare off any zombies who might see us. If that doesn't work, she'll use her fire magic to burn everything within a ten-foot radius.
                        We make it through the forest without incident. When we reach the edge of the trees, we stop and look around. There are several hundred zombies surrounding us.
                        "What now?" one of my companions whispers.
                        "First things first," I say. "Let's try to get close enough so we can attack."
                        A dozen of us spread out and run toward the mass of zombies. I focus my power on summoning a powerful fireball. A bright orange sphere forms inside my palm. When it's ready to go, I hurl it straight at the zombies.
                        They scream and scatter in all directions when they see my fiery ball heading their way. Then, the moment the fireball touches ground, they all charge toward me and Galena. Their hunger for flesh is insatiable.
                        I summon another fireball and throw it at the horde. The zombies split apart as the fireball flies over them. They turn their attention to my burning orb and rush toward the flames.
                        As soon as the fireball hits the ground, dozens of zombies stand up and continue to run toward us. One man falls flat on his ass after he tripped over a zombie whose leg fell off. Other zombies stumble over each other while trying to get away from the fire.
                        Galena uses her earth magic to create a massive rock wall around us. She then casts a spell that creates large rocks to roll down the mountainside and crush the zombies. We were safe for now.</p>
